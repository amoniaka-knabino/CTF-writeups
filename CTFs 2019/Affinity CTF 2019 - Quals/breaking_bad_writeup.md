Note: put flag into AFFCTF{} format.

Solution:

As we can see, encrypted flag consist of pairs of letters - uppercase one and lowercase one.
Pairs look like symbols of chemical elements, we can check each pair - it will be an element.

Let's replace each element symbols with ASCII symbol coded by number of the element in periodic table, we'll get the flag.
